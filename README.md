# Reference

## Commands

All commands require the following data export:

```js
export const data = {
	name: 'name',
	description: 'a description of what the command does',
	options: [], // optional - array of #ApplicationCommandOption
	defaultPermissions: false, // optional - boolean whether to allow access by default
};

export const permissions = []; // optional - array of #ApplicationCommandPermission
```

### Message

Message commands should be exported as shown below:

```js
export const message = true;

export const execute = async (client, msg, args) => {
	// command logic in here
};
```

### Slash

Slash commands should be exported as shown below:

```js
export const slash = true;

export const interaction = async (client, interaction) => {
	// command logic in here
};
```

## Components

Components are are a framework for adding interactive elements to messages. All components require the following exports:

```js
export const data = {
	id: 'id',
};

export const interaction = async (client, interaction) => {
	// component logic in here
};
```

## Events

Events have a different number of arguments passed, check the discord.js documentation for information on each. Always pass the client before any additional arguments.

```js
export const name = 'name';
export const once = true;

export const execute = async (client, ...args) => {
	// event logic in here
};
```

## Database

Currently, the database only supports Redis. However, it is planned to support other databases in the future. This is due to the ease of using mulitple databases in Keyv. The database is accessed through the `client.db` object. It is not required to use a persistant database, but it is recommended. If `REDIS_URI` is not set, an in-memory store will be used.
